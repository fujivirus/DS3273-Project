The data/ directory should contain 10 example data items. If you are doing a classification task, then there should be 10 items per class. They should be in the form that is found in the raw dataset you have used. (e.g. if you downloaded the cats vs dogs dataset from kaggle, then the data directory should contain 10 images of cats and 10 images of dogs in the format thatâ€™s found in that dataset (.jpg files that have not been resized)).
